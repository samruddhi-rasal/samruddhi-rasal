## 🧠 My Attitude Towards Technology

> *“I don’t know it all, but I will figure it out.”*

Technology excites me because of its vast and ever-evolving nature.  
Each project I work on teaches me something new and reveals how much more there is to learn.  
I strongly believe that **learning by building** and **sharing knowledge** are the best ways to grow.
